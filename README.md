# PAV Hematopoiesis Repository

## Overview
Understanding hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and differentiation is challenging due to the complexity of the process and difficulties in observing cellular interactions. This repository provides a quantitative solution: a stochastic dynamical model for long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs). The model accounts for cellular stochasticity, predicts homeostasis, and allows for the simulation of different biological conditions.
